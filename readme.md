This application will store and organize all of your inventory items.

To add an item to the inventory list, select the "Item" tab at the top of the application, and then select "Add" in the dropdown menu.
To delete an item, first select the item you wish to delete in the list, then select "Item" and "Delete" in the dropdown menu.

Adding an item will create a new row in the list with default values.
To edit the values, simply double click the table cell you wish to edit and it will become an editable text box.
Incorrect formatting will yield errors:
    serial codes must only consist of letters and numbers,
    suplicate serial codes are not permitted,
    and values must be numerical.

To search for items, click the search bar in the top right.
Enter a string of characters you wish to search for and press enter.
The inventory list will then show only the items that contain the string you entered in the search bar.
To go back to the full list, click "Show all."

To sort the list, click the header of the column you wish for the list to be sorted by.
The first click will order the list in ascending order.
Click the header again to order the list in descending order. 

To save an inventory list, click the "Save" tab at the top of the application.
The list can either be saved as a HTML file or a TSV file; select the appropriate menu item for your desired file type.
You will then be prompted to enter the directory. Be sure to include a file name, but it is not necessary to include the extension. 
    The directory should look something like this: "C:\Users\Desktop\filename".
The file will be created and populated with the inventory list's items. 

You may also load an inventory list from a file into the application. 
To do so, slect the "Load" tab at the top of the application and select the appropriate file type.
Again, you will be prompted to enter the directory. However, this time you must include the file name.
    It should look like this: "C:\Users\Desktop\inventory.html".
The application's list will then be populated with the contents from the file.
